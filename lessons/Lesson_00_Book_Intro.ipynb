    "# NumPy for Machine Learning: 15-Minute Daily Lessons\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is designed as a practical, hands-on introduction to **NumPy**, tailored specifically for readers preparing to work through *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lessons are short (≈15 minutes each), runnable in Google Colab, and intended for beginners with basic Python knowledge. They cover the essential NumPy concepts required to succeed in machine learning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Book\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each lesson is a standalone **Colab notebook**.\n",
    "- Work through one per day (≈3 lessons per week = 6 weeks, or daily = 3 weeks).\n",
    "- Each lesson has examples, explanations, and a short exercise.\n",
    "- Open in Colab, run cells, and try the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Study Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "The 18 lessons can be studied over two to three weeks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Week 1:** Lessons 1–6 (Foundations & Indexing)\n",
    "- **Week 2:** Lessons 7–12 (Boolean logic, scaling, reshaping, broadcasting)\n",
    "- **Week 3:** Lessons 13–18 (Aggregations, randomness, performance, advanced indexing, capstone)\n",
    "\n",
